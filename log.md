#### Day 0: August 01, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on the basic JavaScript function, variable, condition.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle with Js in general, thought it was an undertakeable task but more i use it more i get confortable with it and more i can thought of the box, really the logic i get in school is so useless here.

#### Day 1: August 02, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on access json object into an html page with some interaction.

**Thoughts:** At first this challenge was for a job position but i take too much time so i fail but still i really enjoy work on this challenge, got stuck few hour but when i finally got the solution and its worked its such a good feeling ;)

#### Day 2: August 03, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: After the json of yesterday back to the basic js by playing with function, string, condition, etc.

**Thoughts:** In the begining and i mean begining of learn js i was always looking on google for the solution as fast as possible beceause js was so not my things and since i star this challenge i take on myself to complete the challenge by using as less as possible the solution of other people of course i still use the MDN documentation but event that i got surprise by see i can remember some method for complete my challenge i can't really wait to be on my 100 days for see where i will stand =)
