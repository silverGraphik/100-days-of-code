# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### My goal for the 100 Days of code : 
### - Improve my JavaScript by Practicing everyday
### - Learn TypeScript
### - Learn the new syntax (ES6, ES7)
### - Learn atleast one framework (Angularjs, React, Vue)
                                      

#### Day 0: August 01, 2018

(#### **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.)

(#### **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.)
