#### Day 0: August 01, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on the basic JavaScript function, variable, condition.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle with Js in general, thought it was an undertakeable task but more i use it more i get confortable with it and more i can thought of the box, really the logic i get in school is so useless here.

***

#### Day 1: August 02, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on access json object into an html page with some interaction.

**Thoughts:** At first this challenge was for a job position but i take too much time so i fail but still i really enjoy work on this challenge, got stuck few hour but when i finally got the solution and its worked its such a good feeling ;)

#### Day 2: August 03, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: After the json of yesterday back to the basic js by playing with function, string, condition, etc.

**Thoughts:** In the begining and i mean begining of learn js i was always looking on google for the solution as fast as possible beceause js was so not my things and since i star this challenge i take on myself to complete the challenge by using as less as possible the solution of other people of course i still use the MDN documentation but event that i got surprise by see i can remember some method for complete my challenge i can't really wait to be on my 100 days for see where i will stand =)

#### Day 4: August 05, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Today still work on basic js.

**Thoughts:** Today its sunday so i'm not in the mood for study much too but still i do my 1hour of code for complete the challenge and keep a rythm, usually i study more than one hour but today  i really not have the mood for that, but even whiteout mood its still important for me to keep doing the challenge everyday, beceause even if today its difficult the next day will be less difficult beceause i choose this day to force myself into it even if don't want ;)

#### Day 5: August 06, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Just finish my javascript basic review by finishing more than 100 little exercice.

**Thoughts:** finally got finish the js exercice, those challenge was not much difficult but the repetition make them become boring and i'm glad for i finished them, now i will move to another js exercice, i really want to improve my js by practicing for the method i need to use come in my mind almost right away and for that only one solution practice, practice, practice...

#### Day 6: August 07, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Complete some basic challenge and now switch on read documentation and tutorial for know more about method.

**Thoughts:** Today i continue with some new challenge about the function and i surprise myself to cannot complete some challenge i clearly remember complete few days ago, don't really know why so i decided to stop the challenge by focusing on immprive my js vocabulary (read about new method) like every langage i learn the syntax but the logic and the vocabulary are two thing i need to focus on.
Understand the logic of the people who decide to build js like that will make me more efficient in my own understanding of this langage... i think ;)

#### Day 7: August 08, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Continue my reading on the Js doc find on w3school.

**Thoughts:** the documentation on w3school is nice, easy and complete its a nice way to to know more about method and other js staff and for understand the logic of the lagngage ( i still not understnad this logic) still have 93 more days to cover i can't wait to see my improvement and i think around every 20 days of challenge i will build an challenge to check my current skills and share it on codepen and other social network.

#### Day 8: August 09, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Focus today on learn and try the "use strict" of javascript.

**Thoughts:** Interesting for learn good practice for build script in JS i will definitely use it until i can master js enough and i think even after its still could be useful for the dev part.

#### Day 9: August 10, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Still read the documentation now start the object and json.

**Thoughts:** So few month ago i discover the object in js and json and i was so amaze by the possiblities its can give, and now i start read about it and i wonder what can i do with it ? where is the limit ? i don't know and i'm still a newbie in js but i want try understand deep js and object seems to be a good way to achieve it when i was reading about object and its say array is an object and every object is an from a prototype object its make me see js with a new look.

#### Day 10: August 11, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Build a simple slider for a friend and get stuck beceause of the script get declare in the head.

**Thoughts:** So today i took 10 min for build a simple slider with js and i got stuck beceuase of a stupid thing... i declare my scrip src on the head of the html and so i get stuck 2 hour try to figure why it was not working until i finally remember the stupidity about the js load first before the html making all my variable empty when the html load and of course got the result of a beautiful white page, so i look for write a condition who will check if the html is load or not and its working but still its not have the same comportement of when the js file get declare before the closing body tag, its been something i need to look at and i understand why developer declare js file before the closing body, its could be great if in the futur Ecma try to find an easy solution for fix that.

#### Day 11: August 12, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Continue my lecture on the js documentation on w3school website.

**Thoughts:** I still have alot to cover on the documentation i read it all and i know some people think its quite useless beceause when you encounter en problem so you can go check it but still read this documentation is really helpfull first i can understand js more better than when i start and second i think about what i read and about how i can use those staff i learn, honnestly i find that really helpfull its give me a better understanding of the hoisting and about some staff like the HTMLCollection yesterday when i build my slider i encounter that and i thought it was an object so i try access it by the property but not work so i try access it like an array but still i could not (probabely beceause my file was declare in the head html) and today after read the part of the dom i understand about even if its look like an array htmlcollection is not an array, so really i think every people who want play with js should take few days for read all the doc.
