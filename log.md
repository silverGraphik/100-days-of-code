#### Day 0: August 01, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on the basic JavaScript function, variable, condition.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle with Js in general, thought it was an undertakeable task but more i use it more i get confortable with it and more i can thought of the box, really the logic i get in school is so useless here.
