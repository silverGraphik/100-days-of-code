#### Day 0: August 01, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on the basic JavaScript function, variable, condition.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle with Js in general, thought it was an undertakeable task but more i use it more i get confortable with it and more i can thought of the box, really the logic i get in school is so useless here.

#### Day 1: August 02, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on access json object into an html page with some interaction.

**Thoughts:** At first this challenge was for a job position but i take too much time so i fail but still i really enjoy work on this challenge, got stuck few hour but when i finally got the solution and its worked its such a good feeling ;)
