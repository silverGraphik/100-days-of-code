#### Day 0: August 01, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on the basic JavaScript function, variable, condition.

**Thoughts:** I always struggle with Js in general, thought it was an undertakeable task but more i use it more i get confortable with it and more i can thought of the box, really the logic i get in school is so useless here.

#### Day 1: August 02, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Working on access json object into an html page with some interaction.

**Thoughts:** At first this challenge was for a job position but i take too much time so i fail but still i really enjoy work on this challenge, got stuck few hour but when i finally got the solution and its worked its such a good feeling ;)

#### Day 2: August 03, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: After the json of yesterday back to the basic js by playing with function, string, condition, etc.

**Thoughts:** In the begining and i mean begining of learn js i was always looking on google for the solution as fast as possible beceause js was so not my things and since i star this challenge i take on myself to complete the challenge by using as less as possible the solution of other people of course i still use the MDN documentation but event that i got surprise by see i can remember some method for complete my challenge i can't really wait to be on my 100 days for see where i will stand =)

#### Day 4: August 05, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Today still work on basic js.

**Thoughts:** Today its sunday so i'm not in the mood for study much too but still i do my 1hour of code for complete the challenge and keep a rythm, usually i study more than one hour but today  i really not have the mood for that, but even whiteout mood its still important for me to keep doing the challenge everyday, beceause even if today its difficult the next day will be less difficult beceause i choose this day to force myself into it even if don't want ;)

#### Day 5: August 06, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Just finish my javascript basic review by finishing more than 100 little exercice.

**Thoughts:** finally got finish the js exercice, those challenge was not much difficult but the repetition make them become boring and i'm glad for i finished them, now i will move to another js exercice, i really want to improve my js by practicing for the method i need to use come in my mind almost right away and for that only one solution practice, practice, practice...

#### Day 6: August 07, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Complete some basic challenge and now switch on read documentation and tutorial for know more about method.

**Thoughts:** Today i continue with some new challenge about the function and i surprise myself to cannot complete some challenge i clearly remember complete few days ago, don't really know why so i decided to stop the challenge by focusing on immprive my js vocabulary (read about new method) like every langage i learn the syntax but the logic and the vocabulary are two thing i need to focus on.
Understand the logic of the people who decide to build js like that will make me more efficient in my own understanding of this langage... i think ;)

#### Day 7: August 08, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Continue my reading on the Js doc find on w3school.

**Thoughts:** the documentation on w3school is nice, easy and complete its a nice way to to know more about method and other js staff and for understand the logic of the lagngage ( i still not understnad this logic) still have 93 more days to cover i can't wait to see my improvement and i think around every 20 days of challenge i will build an challenge to check my current skills and share it on codepen and other social network.

#### Day 8: August 09, 2018

#### **Today's Progress**: Focus today on learn and try the "use strict" of javascript.

**Thoughts:** Interesting for learn good practice for build script in JS i will definitely use it until i can master js enough and i think even after its still could be useful for the dev part.
